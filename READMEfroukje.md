# LightSaberFroukje2

Hi, for this project i have implemented all the things that were necessary:
- i have set upt he VR rig
- i have spawn the cubes
- cubes are destroyed when hit by one of the sabers

for extra points i did all 4 of them:
- cubes are now spawned to the beat (by changing wait time)
- cubes are cut in the cutting direction, with the sword script (not in use here)
- psot procesing is added, see lights
- ezyslice is added, as you acn see with the cubes that fall
i have added some animation and boxes going around, and i have put a different backgorund. Lastly, the cubes are gone when not hit, as also shown in the video.

was a nice project!
